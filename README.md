I encountered the issue 'unrelated histories' with git. I created the README.md file in my remote repository via GItHub AFTER cloning it onto my computer. I was not able to merge my main branch with the remote repository since they had no relationship. I fixed the issue by removing the cloned repository and cloned it again. I learnt that 'git clone' duplicates the remote repo onto the computer as a directory on its own: I did not need to make a folder for it to be cloned into.

A challenge I've learnt from through this project is how to write git commit messages. 4 git commits in, half of which I appended for improved clarity, I am getting a decent idea on when and how to commit 'feat's. I am gaining an clearer understanding of git vocabulary, such as 'upstream rebase / changes' and have deepened my understanding of the remote repository origin and the main branch.
